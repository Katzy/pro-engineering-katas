# Week 1 Katas

The katas this week will be all about RSpec, RSpec, RSpec.  Make sure you install all the gems you need by running

```shell-session
$ bundle install
```

from the `pro-engineering-katas` directory.

As for the specs, look at the specs in the `specs` directory.  From the `week-01` directory you can run a particular spec with, e.g.,

```shell-session
$ rspec specs/person_spec.rb
```

If you have any questions, drop a note in the [#pro-engineering Slack channel](https://codeunion.slack.com/messages/pro-engineering/).
